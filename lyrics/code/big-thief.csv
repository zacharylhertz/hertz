Such a vision in the sun, how they lay low
I catch my breath and count my dough
And I only live to run and I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me

She always knew
She'll always know
That I loved her oh so well, but I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me

You and I were born with the same design
Nothing in the world will make you make your mind up

"2","Paul","Big Thief",2016,"[Verse 1]
Oh, the last time I saw Paul
I was horrible and almost let him in
But I stopped and caught the wall
And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin
Yeah, we hopped inside my car
And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
And he turned the headlights off
Then he pulled the bottle out
And then he showed me what was love

[Chorus]
I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 2]
In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 3]
Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain

I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath

"3","Randy","Big Thief",2016,"Oh Randy, leave it up to me
I'll pour the water if you bring the tree

I only see two or three colors

What's it like to breathe in?
Find a friend and gather with him?
I'm a wolf in a city of women
You only know the light is on

Will you plant that sycamore baby?
I'll watch it grow from the second floor
I haven't left the house much lately
And you don't come around here anymore

And all those lovers in their velvet gowns
I wanna take that trip uptown
Will you tell them to let me out
When you can see the light is on?

Found a horse hair in my food
There's a raccoon in my room
There are bluejays all in bloom
All along the cement floor
Randy, they say I've gone insane
So could you take me dancing in the pouring rain?
You don't know me but you know my name
Will you say it 'til the light is gone?",2475982

Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, “can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right

Old stars filling up my throat

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

"5","Vegas","Big Thief",2016,"Holed up in Vegas for only one week
And I caught you tongue and cheek by the side of the road
Of an automobile expo
Turned up the volume and you started to weep
And I thought you a lamb

Even in the sigh of the headlight sea
Your tears were salty ocean
You opened up the engine and listened to it sing
And I thought you a lamb

You knew your daddy 'til you were thirteen
And then he took his leave for the likes of the land
And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again

Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway

We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean
And then you recommended I'm a woman to keep
And I called you a man",2486770

She needs your hand though your eyes are blurry

She is getting thin
You are growing gray and white
And you don't know how to tell her as you say goodnight

Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time

You could hold her close
At night in your slumber
Dream her as a child when you loved her mother

Now you're in her house
She is smiling in a dress
She is not a woman, you are just a guest

Oh, Lorraine on a Saturday morning
Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning hands

We fell asleep in the back of the warehouse
I woke to you kneading and covering my mouth

Liza waited in the room

Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, """"What's done is done.""""
And he was not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade

When he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing said

You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines
Of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you
Who’s trying to raise a child in me

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend’s knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought
Could love and take better care
I have an older brother I don’t know
He could be anywhere

Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag
Soaking up blood with your eye
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, “Don’t let my baby die.”

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole her glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam

And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with her part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering
[Chorus]
As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Verse 3]
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail

The planets in rows

Playing on, insane

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time

Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night

[Poem]
Sitting on steps, the topmost
There's a pasture before me
Where the brief shadows of small trees are plain to see at 2 a.m
Where the moon lights the back of a head
Bowed in respect of all that is
I'm not sure I want to talk anymore
Maybe there is something I could say a poet would feel
Maybe there's no need
A true poet already sits beside me
Head bowed to the moonlight
I am at once alone and inside everything
Even in the den of the world there is a silence that sings of reverence
There is a space that cannot be described
In that space words are noise:
Substantiated evidence of distraction, a step behind now
An understandable preoccupation of the mind's attempt at solving a mystery
So I am not sure if I want to talk anymore
Some days my heart is heavier than I knew I could bear
Some days it floats beyond gravity's reach
And words are heavy
To use them lets loose an anchor that only proves the science of causality
I know these things
Though the knowing mostly serves as a reminder of an absence
Maybe only momentary, or
Until the moon shines once more on a poet's bowed head
So I am not sure I want (much) to talk
There is no sayable clarity
No translation in large print
There is only this moment
And I live inside it alone
But look upon the world with eyes that say what can't be said

One, two, one, two, three, four

Electric waves, a rush of energy
Silent river pouring backward eternally
Through the phase and touch of entropy
Old age in the beginner
To hit the stage and blush wild, laughingly
Crush the rage and rush time tappingly
Call the name so much so vapidly
Dissolving into thin air
Turning the two-fork taped-up television
Into tunnel vision
Taking the new fork tactile as revision
Working the revision

Through distortion's secret telеphone

After the heat rush feeds and thrives
After the bushfire burns and dies

Desert ground so cold and clean
Spreading out like a magazine
Reading the dirt like gossip
What do the weeds say? They say
""""Everything, everything, everything falls through
Each dimension breaks in two
Like the two hands clapping
Like the two wings flapping
Everything, everything, everything for free
As it all eventually
Turns to dust and petal
Molten rock and meadow""""

Blue lightning was an autograph signing up the sky
To the question that I had to ask, she only answered, """"Why?""""
Angelia took the photograph, the moment had to die
Years later, like an epitaph, we read it and we cry
This morning, I went to have a bath, the water ran dry
Clear warning, has it come at last, the time to say goodbye?
Can we make love? Can we hold fast? I really wanna try

Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

Blue heron, now you're scaring me, you circle and dive
Blue angel, yeah, you're in my dreams, swearing every night
And a spider just beside her, larger than a hill
And it's plain to see if she don't comfort me, the rattlesnake will

I already died
I'm singing from the other side
Underneath love
Avoidance and pride
I look you in the face and lie
I tell you I want your love
You're the cigarette in my fist
You are so hard to resist
I can't help but breathe your love
When I'm scared to die alone
That's when I call you on the phone
I tell you that I need your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Oh, frailty and fragile words
You tell me a lot of words
You tell me all about your love
And I feel what I hear you say
I don't talk the same way
'Cause that don't feel like love
As the dog opens his eyes
As the blue crow flies
I'm going to meet my love
I already died
I'm calling from the other side
Underneath love
There's a bottle out in the sea
With a message inside from me
Saying, """"Release my love""""

Release my love, my love

But because of fear, because of fear you draw the line between us
